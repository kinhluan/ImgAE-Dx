# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform. Pipfile.lock may vary on different platforms.
#   For more information, see: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-lock-security
#   Therefore, in case of cross-platform development, it is better to ignore Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   For more information, see: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
